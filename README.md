# DeliveryChecker

Create a program that will take a list of deliveries and a path, determine if the given path is acceptable to complete all deliveries, and if it is, return a list of steps to give to the truck driver.

## ▶️ How to Run the Script

The script expects **two JSON arguments** from the command line:

```bash
python deliverychecker.py "<deliveries>" "<path>"

# Example:
python deliverychecker.py "[[1,3],[2,5]]" "[1,2,3,4,5]"
```
